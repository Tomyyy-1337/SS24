a)
Head1:
PeakPerformance = CPI * Core_Frequency * Core_Count * CPU_Count
    = 1 * 3.2Ghz * 8 * 2
    = 51.2 GFLOPS
head3:
PeakPerformance = CPI * Core_Frequency * Core_Count * CPU_Count
    = 1 * 2.6Ghz * 12 * 2
    = 62.4 GFLOPS

b)
processor: Id of the cpu thread, starting at 0
physical id: Id of the physical CPU, starting at 0
siblings: Number of threads per core
core id: Id of the core, starting at 0 
cpu cores: number of physical cpu cores on the cpu

c)
head1:
Cores per Cpu: 8
Core_Frequency: 3.2 2Ghz
Bytes to load: 16 (x[i] and z[i])
Bytes to store: 8 (store ressult in y[i])

Every loop step contains two loads, one store, one addition, one conditional branch and one increment.
Only the values inside the Arrays need to be loadet from main memory, i is stored in the cache.
We assume CPI = 1 from task 1a).
Therfore 3 out of 6 operations access the main memory.
The required memory bandwidth for one core is (3/6) * 8 Bytes * 3.2Ghz = 12.8 GB/s
The required memory bandwidth for 8 Cores is 8 * 12.8 GB/s = 102.4 GB/s

head3:
Cores per Cpu: 12
Core_Frequency: 2.6 Ghz
The required memory bandwidth for one core is (3/6) * 8 Bytes * 2.6 Ghz = 10.4 GB/s
The required memory bandwidth for 8 Cores is 12 * 10.4 GB/s = 124.8 GB/s
