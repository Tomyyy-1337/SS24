Load the openmpi:
[~] module load openmpi/5.0.3

Compile:
See run-script

Run the code:
[~] sbatch run.sh

a)
main.cpp and main_alt.cpp take ~0.053 and ~0.063 to execute the loop with MPI.
Ex06 Task 1 took 0.006492s on one core, 0.003055s on four cores and 0.001617s on all available cores on skylake-96 with OpenMP

b)
main_alt.cpp took 0.0476319s to execute.

OpenMP performs much better than MPI.
